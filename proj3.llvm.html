<h1>CS 701, Project 3 <br> Global Code Optimizations</h1>

<h2>Due: Thursday, November 20, 2008 (midnight) <br> Not accepted after: Thursday, December 4, 2008 (midnight)</h2>

<p></p></center><p></p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>For this project, you will implement four related optimizations using LLVM:</p>

<ol>
<li>Move loop-invariant computations out of loops.</li>
<li>Fold and propagate constants.</li>
<li>Eliminate dead instructions. </li>
<li>Propagate constants through conditionals.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Each optimization should be written as a pass, in a fashion similar to
<code>Stroll</code> from Project 2. Keep all of your code for this project in a
single subdirectory of <code>llvm/lib/</code>, both for the sake of the grader
and to simplify your build/test cycle. The makefile from the <code>Stroll</code>
directory, copied to your directory and suitably edited, will build
your passes into a single dynamic library. As before, to invoke a pass
named <code>pass701</code> in library <code>lib.so</code> on the bytecode file <code>foo.bc</code>, do:</p>

<pre><code>    opt -load lib.so -pass701 foo.bc -f -o foo-opt.bc
</code></pre>

<p>Passing the <code>-stats</code> flag to <code>opt</code> instructs the pass manager to print
any statistics that you have defined with the <code>STATISTIC</code> macro. Using
these macros in your programs should help you track your progress and
catch errors.</p>

<p>Each of the passes in this assignment is already an optimization
pass in LLVM. So, do not call LLVM's pass for an optimization while
implementing your own version of that optimization, and do not copy
LLVM's code from those passes.</p>

<h2>Loop-Invariant Code Motion</h2>

<p>For this part of the project you will identify loop-invariant
expressions, and move their computations out of those loops. Instead
of manually finding natural loops, you should probably build your
analysis as a <a href="http://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1LoopPass.html">LoopPass</a>.</p>

<p>The computations of loop-invariant expressions should be moved to the
loop's preheader. The preheader of a loop is a CFG node that is the
(unique) immediate predecessor of the loop header from outside the
loop.</p>

<p>You do not need to worry about profitability (is moving the invariant
a guaranteed improvement), but you do need to worry about safety, so,
you should not move any computation that might cause a run-time error,
undefined behavior, or other uncontrolled side effects. In particular,
you should not move instructions in which the opcode is <code>*div</code> or
<code>*rem</code>. (You can move them if you can guarantee that the denominator
is non-zero, but such movement is not required in this assignment.)
Also, instructions that involve memory (<code>malloc</code>, <code>load</code>, <code>store</code>,
etc.)  should not be considered loop invariant.</p>

<p>Think carefully about <code>phi</code> nodes.</p>

<p>Register this pass with the name <code>licm701</code>, through the same mechanism
that <code>Stroll.cpp</code> from Project 2 used to register itself as an <code>opt</code>
pass.</p>

<p>This pass should keep track of how many instructions have been
moved, using the <code>STATISTIC</code> macro discussed in Project 2.</p>

<h2>Constant Folding and Propagation</h2>

<p>For this part of the project you will look for values computed as pure
functions of constants (e.g. 1+2), and replace those values with the
evaluated constant value (e.g. 3). Any of the instructions listed in
<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#constantexprs">constant
expressions</a> is a
pure function.</p>

<p>Register this pass with the name <code>cp701</code>. This pass should maintain as
a <code>STATISTIC</code> how many instructions have been removed.</p>

<h2>Dead Instruction Elimination</h2>

<p>Recall that an assignment is dead if it is not live immediately after
the assignment. For this part of the project you will identify and
remove all instructions that correspond to useless assignments. That
is, remove any values that have no uses.</p>

<p>Register this pass with the name <code>die701</code>. This pass should maintain
as a <code>STATISTIC</code> how many instructions have been removed.</p>

<h2>Conditional Constant Propagation</h2>

<p>If the compiler can determine that the predicate of a conditional <code>br</code> or
<code>switch</code> instruction is a constant, then it can replace that instruction with an
unconditional branch and possibly remove entire blocks of dead code.
For this part of the project:</p>

<ol>
<li>Perform constant propagation, by requiring the <code>cp701</code> pass.</li>
<li>Replace <code>br</code> and <code>switch</code> instructions that have constant conditions with
unconditional <code>br</code> instructions.</li>
<li>Perform a data flow analysis to determine which basic blocks are
now reachable.</li>
<li>Remove unreachable basic blocks.</li>
</ol>

<p>Register this pass with the name <code>ccp701</code>. This pass should maintain
as a <code>STATISTIC</code> the number of instructions turned into unconditional
<code>br</code> instructions.</p>

<h2>Repeating Your Optimizations</h2>

<p>Each of the optimizations you've now coded may benefit from being run
after the other optimizations you've coded. To demonstrate this, try
optimizing your code with the <code>iter-opt</code> script, available on the CSL
machines at <code>~cs701-1/public/llvm/scripts/</code>.</p>

<p>To ready <code>iter-opt</code> for use, you'll need to change a few settings in
the script itself. In particular, you <em>must</em> modify <code>llvm_bin</code> to
reflect your LLVM binary, and <code>dynlib</code> to reflect the location of the
dynamic library that contains your optimizations.</p>

<p>To use <code>iter-opt</code>, run <code>iter-opt &lt;file&gt;</code>. If <code>&lt;file&gt;</code> is LLVM bitcode
of a stand-alone C file, <code>iter-opt</code> will repeatedly run your
optimizations. It runs each pass repeatedly, until they report only
<code>STATISTIC</code>s of 0, i.e. until they can no longer collectively further
optimize the program. (The script will also stop after it runs every
program eight times, to guard against sequences of optimizations that
don't converge.)  If you have not implemented <code>STATISTIC</code>s in your
passes, this behavior will be hidden; add them to observe this
behavior.</p>

<h2>Grading Criteria</h2>

<p>
As was the case for project 2, this project may be done individually or in two person teams.
Your grade will be based on the correctness of your implementation, a
subjective evaluation of the quality of your code, and on the features
you implement.</p>

<h2>What to Hand In</h2>

<p>Please copy the following files to your subdirectory of the handin
directory (~cs701-1/public/proj3/handin):</p>

<ol>
<li>The subdirectory of <code>llvm-2.3/lib</code> where you put your code, and
all of its contents.</li>
<li>A file named README that tells which features you implemented. </li>
</ol>

<p>Be sure not to copy any object files or binary libraries, as they take
up a lot of space and may cause the directory to exceed its quota.</p>

<h2>Late Policy</h2>

<p>This project is due by midnight on November 20. The project may be
handed in as late as midnight on Tuesday, December 2, with a late
penalty of 2% per day.</p>
